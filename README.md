The system consists of the following components:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52ab1b23-3f3a-474f-bf50-00ada5601580)

1. **Data Ingestion**: Polls external APIs and publishes data into Kafka topics.
2. **Real-Time Processing**: Uses Spark to process and transform data.
3. **Intermediate Storage**: Stores semi-structured data in MongoDB.
4. **Transformation**: Converts MongoDB data to a relational format using Python scripts.
5. **Persistent Storage**: Stores structured data in MySQL.
6. **Visualization**: Provides real-time analytics via the React frontend and Django API.

## Data Pipeline Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - External API â†’ Kafka Producers â†’ Kafka Topics.

2. **Real-Time Processing**:
   - Kafka Topics â†’ Spark Streaming â†’ MongoDB Collections.

3. **Transformation to Relational Format**:
   - MongoDB â†’ Python Script â†’ MySQL Tables.

4. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - MySQL â†’ Django API â†’ React Frontend.
